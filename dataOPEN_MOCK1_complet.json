        "question": "In June 2021, applicant C filed an international patent application PCT-C. PCT-C was filed in Chinese with the Chinese Patent Office as the Receiving Office and searched by that Office as International Searching Authority (ISA). PCT-C validly claims priority from an earlier application filed by same applicant C in July 2020. Applicant C wishes to obtain a patent for PCT-C in all the members states of the EPC as soon as possible. The international patent application and the international search report were published in January 2022. The PCT pamphlet comprises 15 pages of description, 5 claims and no drawings. In the frame of PCT Chapter II, applicant C filed under Art. 34 PCT a new set of claims comprising 19 claims. Based on this new set of claims, a positive International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) has then been issued by the Chinese patent office acting as International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) in October 2022. In a letter received by your firm today (21 November 2022), the applicant asks you to start immediately the procedure for the grant of a European Patent in respect of PCT-C on the basis of the documents on which the IPER was based. \nQ1 What needs to be done and which fees need to be paid to ensure that the EPO starts the examination under Article 94 EPC as soon as possible?",
        "answer": "The applicant has to request entry into the regional phase before the EPO either by using Form 1200 or in a separate letter giving all the information required by Form 1200. The applicant has to: \n - select the box for early processing on Form 1200 \n - pay the filing fees and search fees \n - PCT-C was filed in Chinese, searched by the CNIPA as International Searching Authority and, in accordance with Rule 48.3(a) PCT, published in Chinese. Since the Euro-PCT application was published in 'another language', Article 153(4) EPC requires that a translation into German, English or French be filed. In accordance with Rule 159(1)(a) EPC, this translation has to be filed upon entry into the European phase, i.e. today. \n - submit a translation of the amended claims filed under Article 34 PCT \n - pay claims fees for 4 claims and the examination and designation fees The applicant has to specify the application documents on which the European grant procedure is to be based (Rule 159(1)(b) EPC). The applicant must file a valid request for examination, which includes paying the examination fee (see point 15 of the notice from the EPO concerning the request for early processing, OJ EPO 2013, 156). The applicant should waive the right to be asked under Rule 70(2) EPC whether it wishes to proceed further (see point 16 of the notice from the EPO), and waive the right to receive the communication under Rule 161(2) EPC, (see OJ EPO 2011, 354).",

        "question": "Your client, the company Happycook GmbH is a manufacturer of kitchen appliances with headquarters in Germany. On 7 October 2021 your client filed a European patent application for which they validly paid the filing fee and search fee. The Extended European Search Report was received on 10 May 2022 containing 4 X citations, 2 Y citations and 2 A citations. The report was analyzed by a patent attorney in your firm who prepared amended description and claims and a letter with arguments and explanation of the amendments. Your client approaches you on 1 June 2022 and asks you to file an international patent application before 15 June 2022. Your client asks you to include in the filing package for the international patent application not only the amended description and claims, but also the letter with arguments and explanation of the amendments. \nQ4-1 Which procedure makes it possible to include such a letter with arguments and explanation of the amendments in the filing package of the international patent application? \nQ4-2 Which receiving Office(s) and which International Searching Authority(ies) can be selected when you want to apply this procedure? Please give reasons for your answer. \nQ4-3 How can you obtain a patent in Taiwan for this invention? You file the international patent application on 3 June 2022. The next day it is noted that the filing date of the priority application was erroneously entered as 10 July 2021. The correct filing date of the priority application is 7 October 2021.received \nQ4-4 What is the time limit for correcting this mistake? Please give reasons for your answer. On 1 September 2022 the International Search Report is received including the Written Opinion. Unfortunately, the report still cites prior art, and the claims are not yet found novel and inventive. \nYour client is very eager to get a positive International Preliminary Examination Report (IPER) before entering the national phase to speed up the process and requests you to file a Demand. \nQ4-5 Until when can a Demand be filed? Please give reasons for your answer. \nQ4-6 Which office(s) are competent International Preliminary Examining Authorities for that Demand? Please give reasons for your answer. \nQ4-7 Do you need to wait until the application has been published before entry into the national/regional phase? Please give reasons for your answer.",
        "answer": "Q4-1 PCT Direct procedure (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1-3). \nQ4-2 The EPO has to be used as International Searching Authority (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1) because PCT Direct is a service offered by the EPO. Receiving office can be any office open to a German applicant (OJ EPO 2017, A21): DPMA, IB, EPO. \nQ4-3 Taiwan is not a PCT contracting state (PCT Applicant's Guide â€’ International Phase â€“ Annex A). The solution is to file national patent application in Taiwan within the priority year, claiming priority of the European patent application. \nQ4-4. 10 November 2022. (Rule 26bis.1(a)) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. 16 months from 10 July 2021 (earlier of 2 priority dates) = 10 November 2022 4 months from 3 June 2022 = 3 October 2022 The answer is therefore 10 November 2022, as it is later than 3 October 2022. \nQ4-5 7 August 2023. (Rule 54bis.1(a)): 22 months from priority date or 3 months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and of the written opinion established under R. 43bis.1, whichever period expires later. 7 October 2021 + 22 months = 7 August 2023. Receipt of the international search report on 1 September 2022 + 3 months = 1 December 2022, which is earlier. \nQ4-6 Only the EPO (PCT Applicant's Guide, Annex C, EP). \nQ4-7 No, entry into the national/regional phase is possible at any time after validly filing the PCT application. The applicable time limit for performing the acts for entry into the national/regional phase is 30-31 months from the filing date or, if priority has been claimed, the priority date. Therefore, the national/regional offices will not commence processing an international application before the 30-31- month time limit has expired. An exception applies if the applicant lifts the processing ban earlier. To do this, the applicant has to file a request for early processing (under Article 23(2) or 40(2) PCT) with the designated/elected Office and comply with the requirements for the request to be effective.",

Consider the following situation: \nQ5-3 In response to the communication, applicant A immediately withdrew the appeal. Will the appeal fee be reimbursed?",
        "answer": "Q5-1 The deadline for filing notice of appeal is 2 months from the date of notification of the decision to refuse. Therefore: 14 March 2022 + 10 days = 24 March 2022 24 March 2022 + 2 months = 24 May 2022 (Tuesday) Deadline for filing notice of appeal = 24 May 2022. \nQ5-2 The deadline for filing the grounds of appeal is 4 months from the date of notification of the decision to refuse. Therefore: 14 March 2022 + 10 days = 24 March 2022 24 March 2022+ 4 months = 24 July 2022 (Sunday) Deadline for filing grounds of appeal = 25 July 2022 (Under Rule 103(1)(b)) If the appeal is withdrawn before the grounds of appeal are filed and before the period for filing them has expired, the appeal fee will be reimbursed in full. In this case, the appeal was withdrawn on 5 July 2022. Therefore, the appeal fee will be refunded in full (under Rule 103(1)(b)). \nQ5-3 (Under Rule 103(3)(b)) If the appeal is withdrawn after the Board of Appeal has issued a communication inviting observations but before expiry of the period set by the Board for filing them, the appeal fee will be reimbursed at 50%. In this case, as the appeal was withdrawn immediately after the communication inviting observations, the appeal fee will be refunded at 50%.",
