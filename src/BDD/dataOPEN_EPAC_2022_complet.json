        "question": "On 22 May 2020, applicant B filed US application US-B in English. Despite all due care\u202fbeing taken  by applicant B, international application PCT-B claiming priority from US-B\u202fwas only filed on 7 June  2021. The USPTO, acting as receiving Office, granted the\u202fapplicant\u2019s request for restoration of the  right of priority on the basis that the\u202ffailure to file PCT-B within the priority period was  unintentional.\u202f\u202f\u202f   \u202f   On 9 December 2022, applicant B took all the steps required under Rule 159 EPC for PCT-B to  enter the European phase before the EPO.\u202f\u202f\u202f   \u202f   When did the time limit for filing the request for restoration of the right of priority at the USPTO  acting as receiving Office expire?      What must be done before the EPO as designated Office, and by when, to ensure\u202fthat the  restoration of the right of priority is effective in the European phase?",
        "answer": "(a) The request for restoration had to be filed within two months of the date on which \nthe priority period expired, which is 26 July 2021. \n(The priority period expired on 22 May 2021 extended to 24 May 2021.  \n24 May 2021 + 2 months => 24 July 2021, extended to 26 July 2021). \n \n(b) (The restoration granted by the USPTO as receiving Office will not automatically be \neffective before the EPO because the EPO is not bound by the decision of any \nreceiving Office under the \"unintentional criterion\".)  \nTo ensure that priority is restored during the European phase, the applicant should \nrequest restoration of priority within one month of the date on which the time limit for \nentry into EPO regional phase expires (Article 22 PCT) \n(Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT; Rule 159(1)) EPC sets a 31-month deadline) \n22.05.2020 + 31 months = 22.12.2022  \n22.12.2022 + 1 month = 22.01.2023 (Sunday) extended to 23.01.2023 \n(Monday).  \n \n \n \n8 \nThe fee for restoration of priority must be paid within the same time limit \n(Rule 49ter.2(b)(iii), (d) PCT).  \nThe request for restoration of priority must be accompanied by a statement of reasons \nfor the failure, despite meeting the due-care requirement, to file the international \napplication within the priority period (Rule 49ter.2(b)(ii) PCT).",

        "question": "Your client CoffeeBreak filed a European patent application claiming a new type of coffee maker  on 20\u202fDecember 2021 but withdrew it before search. CoffeeBreak then asked you to file an  international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application and with no  amendments compared to that application. The priority application contains drawings that are  essential for understanding the invention.\u202f   \u202f\u202f   On 5 December 2022, you filed an international patent application claiming priority of the European  patent application at the International Bureau, using PCT/RO/101. Your colleague handling a  patent application for shoe soles left by mistake his drawings in your filing folder. Therefore, you  filed the wrong drawings with the international patent application claiming the coffee maker instead  of the correct drawings.\u202f\u202f       2     a.  You discover your mistake today, 12 December 2022. Assuming that the  International Bureau does not detect the wrong drawings, what actions can you take of your  own volition to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent  application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for  performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer.\u202f      b.  You do not discover your mistake until receiving a PCT/RO/107 notification dated  4\u202fJanuary 2023from the International Bureau. What actions can you take to ensure that the  correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the  original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please  give reasons for your answer      c.  What would be your answer to previous questions (a) and (b) if, at your client's  request, you had not claimed priority of the European patent application? Please give  reasons for your answer.   \u202f      You do not discover your mistake on filing the wrong drawings, and completely miss the notification  dated 4\u202fJanuary 2023 from the International Bureau. You only find out about the mistake on  27\u202fApril 2023 after receiving the written opinion. The invention has not been and will not be made  public by any means other than publication by the International Bureau. You intend to withdraw the  international patent application before publication and file a new international patent application  with the correct drawings.\u202f      d.  Will you still be in time to prevent publication of the first international patent  application? Please give reasons for your answer.",
        "answer": "(a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the \npriority application are included in the international patent application through \nincorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). \nSend a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) \ntogether with the confirmation.  \nWithin two months of the original filing date  \n5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to \n6 February. \n \n(b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority \napplication are included in the international patent application through incorporation \nby reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together \nwith the confirmation).  \n \nRO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, \n4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March \n2023 \n \n(c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier \napplication must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). \nThus, no remedy is possible in this case. \n \n(d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of \ntechnical preparations for the publication. \nPublication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, \nwhich is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). \nThe technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the \ndate of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on \nTuesday, 6 June).",

        "question": "On 10 December 2021, your client, a large Romanian company, filed a Romanian national patent  application RO-H. RO-H is drafted in Romanian and comprises 32 pages of description and  drawings, and four pages with 15 claims. Your client has informed you that they will prepare and  forward an English translation of RO-H in due course. This will comprise 29\u202fpages of description  and drawings, four pages with 15 claims and an abstract comprising two pages.\u202f   Your client wants you to file today, 12 December 2022, a European patent application EP-H  drafted in Romanian and claiming priority of RO-H.\u202f      a.  What fees have to be paid and what would be the last date for paying them?\u202f      b.  You filed an automatic debit order for EP-H. On the decisive payment date, you  receive an email from the EPO informing you that there are insufficient funds in your  deposit account to cover any of the fees to be paid (as identified in your answer to question  (a)). You replenish the account two days after receiving the email. Do you have to take any  further action to ensure these fees are paid?\u202f      c.  What is the time limit for filing an English translation of the application via the EPO's  online services? What is the consequence for the time limit if, on the last day of the period  for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services which  prevents you from filing it? The outage lasts for the whole of that day.",
        "answer": "(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by \n12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). \n \n \n9 \nThe filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of \nabstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) \nEPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). \n \n(b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was \nduly replenished (point 8 AAD).  \nSince this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be \nwithdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). \nNo action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account \n(the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the \nfiling fee (which includes the page fee)).  \n \n(c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application \n12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; \nor within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC.  \n \nIf documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted \nby the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be \nreceived on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the \nperiod shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are \navailable (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120).",

        "question": "Applicant A\u202ffiled European patent application EP-A1 in English in May 2019. It describes two  different inventions, X and Y, and claims invention X only. The European search report was drawn  up for invention X only.\u202f\u202f\u202f       3  A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting a time limit of four months for response was  issued by the EPO on 16 May 2022.

No fees were paid, and no claims were submitted at the time of filing.\u202f      What does applicant A have to do to have invention Y searched by the EPO?",
        "answer": "A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending. \nCurrently, EP-A1 is deemed to be withdrawn because no response to the \ncommunication under Article 94(3) EPC was filed. The time limit for filing a response \nexpired on 28 November 2022 (26 Saturday > Monday 28). \nIn order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request \nfurther processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the \ncommunication under Article 94(3) EPC. \n \nThe filing fee and search fee for EP-A2 are due on filing.
