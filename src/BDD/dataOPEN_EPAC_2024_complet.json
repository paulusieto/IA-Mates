What is the time limit for paying these fees? \n3. What happens if these fees are not paid within the time limit, and what can you do about it?",
        "answer": "1. The fees due on filing are the filing fee (including page fees), the search fee and the transmittal fee. \n2. These fees are to be paid within one month of the date of receipt of the international application, i.e. 27 September 2024. \n3. The applicant is invited to pay the fees within one month of the date of the invitation.

        "question": "On 25 October 2019, the Spanish University Isabel II and the company Tomato Matters filed a European patent application in Spanish, accompanied by a translation into English. Tomato Matters employs more than 260 employees. The University Isabel II has filed two patent applications with the EPO over the past five years. On 10 October 2024, Tomato Matters transfers its rights to Naranjas Navel, a company which employs 9 members of staff and whose annual turnover is EUR 1 million. Naranjas Navel has never filed any patent applications with the EPO. In a communication from the EPO under Rule 71(3) EPC dated 10 October 2024, the name of the applicants is given as: Isabe III (clerical error) and Tomato Matters. \n1. What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme? Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts. \n2. Let us now suppose that the request for unitary effect has been refused. What is the time limit for lodging an application to reverse this decision, and to whom should the application be addressed?",
        "answer": "1. Necessary steps: - Request for correction of the name of the applicant. \n - Request to transfer the application, subject to the payment of an administrative fee (0 euro if requested using MyEPO Portfolio). \n - Declaration regarding requirements for a reduction of fees. \n - Payment of reduced sixth renewal fee. \n - Payment of reduced fee for grant and printing; filing of translations of the claims in German and French. \n - Once the decision for grant is issued, filing of request for unitary effect (in English) with translation into any other EU official language. \n - Not entitled to compensation for translation costs because Tomato Matters is not an SME. \n2. The action must be filed at the UPC within three weeks of the refusal (Rule 97.1 RoP UPC). The two-month time limit under Rule 88.1 RoP UPC is not applicable, see Rule 85.2 RoP UPC.",

        "question": "In March 2018, a European patent application was filed in French. A European patent was granted in June 2023. Unitary effect has been registered and the proprietor has filed a statement concerning licences of right. The patent has also been validated in Spain and in Croatia; the European patent is still in force in these states. The proprietor filed a request for limitation of the patent. The examining division has issued an interlocutory decision, indicating that the patent with amended claims and an amended description meets the requirements of the EPC. The mention of the limitation will be published in the last European Patent Bulletin of 2024. \n1. To maintain the existing patents, what translations must be filed, at which offices? \n2. Do any fees have to be paid? Fee amounts need not be mentioned.",
        "answer": "1. No translation is necessary for UP. For Spain, translation of the amended description and the amended claims. For Croatia, translation into Croatian of the claims as amended. \n2. Fee for publication (or special fee) in ES, fee for publication in HR. Renewal fee for the eighth year, reduced by 15% in recognition of statement concerning licences of right for UP.",

        "question": "European application EP1 was filed online on 2 September 2024 without claiming priority. You realise today, 10 October 2024, that priority from CN1 filed in Chinese on 31 August 2023 was not claimed. \n1. Explain why it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 and what steps must be taken. \n2. On the same day, you realise that, despite all due care, you filed the description of another application, instead of the priority application translated into English. It was intended that EP1 should have the same content as CN1. How can you correct this? What will be the effect on the filing date? \n3. What is the consequence with regard to claiming priority from CN1? What action could be taken?",
        "answer": "1. EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1 (31 August 2024, extended to 2 September 2024), so priority can be added. The declaration of priority can be made up to 16 months from earliest priority date: 31 December 2024, extended to 2 January 2025. An applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating: \ni. the date of the previous application \nii. the state or WTO member in or for which it was filed \niii. the application number \n2. The applicant may file of their own volition the correct description within two months of filing (Rule 56a EPC): 2 November 2024, extended to 4 November 2024. Since priority was not claimed on filing, Rule 56a(4) EPC does not apply. The application is re-dated. \n3. As the new filing date falls outside the 12-month priority period, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period should also be filed, together with reasons. And the fee should be paid.",

        "question": "Inventor Mr Tulip, a Dutch national, filed Dutch national patent application NL-1, which comprises 50 pages and includes 20 claims, all in the Dutch language. The EPO established a search report at the request of the Netherlands Patent Office. \nMr Tulip then filed an international patent application WO-1, claiming the priority of, and with the same content (description and claims in Dutch) as, NL-1. \nThe international publication of WO-1, with the international search report, comprises 45 pages, including 1 page of bibliographic data. The EPO acted as International Searching Authority. International preliminary examination was requested in time; however, no amendments were made in the international phase. 30 months have elapsed since the date of filing of NL-1. \nMr Tulip now asks for an indication of the cost of entry into the European phase, i.e. how much he will have to pay in official fees over the next 8 months, if all formal requirements are met but expenses kept to a minimum. This will be his first application with the EPO. Mr Tulip expressly requests that no amendments be made before substantive examination. \nPlease name the fees that need to be paid and state which reductions are available. It is sufficient to indicate how to calculate, but it is not necessary to indicate the amounts nor to provide full calculations.",
        "answer": "Fees to be paid: \n - Filing fee, online filing + ten page fees: 30% micro-entity reduction \n - Fees for five claims (no reduction) \n - Examination fee with the following sequentially combined reductions: 30% micro-entity reduction, 30% reduction if the request for examination is filed in Dutch, 75% reduction because the EPO acted as IPEA \n - Designation fee: 30% micro-entity reduction \n - Renewal fee for the third year: 30% micro-entity reduction",

        "question": "Third-party observations were filed regarding a patent application. They were sent to the applicant with a communication (Form 2022) dated 22 November 2023. \n1. What did the applicant have to do and by what date? \n2. The EPO then sent a communication under Art. 94(3) dated 21 December 2023, setting a period of 4 months to respond. It was received by the applicant on 28 December 2023. The applicant requested a first extension of 2 months in time, and this was granted by a communication dated 19 April 2024 and received on 26 April 2024. The applicant wished to request a second time extension. \nWhat did the applicant then have to do and by what date? \n3. The second request for extension of time was filed on the last possible date but was refused. The applicant was then informed by a noting of loss of rights that the application had been deemed to be withdrawn for failure to file a response in time. Both communications are dated 12 August 2024 and were received on 19 August 2024. \nHow can this be remedied and by what date?",
        "answer": "1. Nothing. \n2. Request a time extension by 21 December 2024 + six months = 21 June 2024. Provide reasons for request. \n3. File response / perform missing act and pay the flat fee for further processing by 14 October 2024 (12 August + two months = 12 October 2024, extended to 14 October 2024).",
