Examination was requested in Spanish at the time of filing the application. The examination and designation fees are due by 7 November 2023 and the applicant has asked you whether he is entitled to a reduction of 20% in the examination fee. What is the correct answer? A. The applicant is entitled to a reduction of 20% in the examination fee under Rule 6(3) EPC and Article 14(1) RFees. B. The applicant is entitled to a reduction in the examination fee under Rule 6(3)EPC and Article 14(1) RFees, but the reduction is not 20%. Answer",

To avoid retaliation, company X would prefer not to file the opposition in its own name. It therefore asks a European patent attorney to file the opposition in her name. Will the EPO accept this? Yes No Only if the patentee does not object Answer",
    "answer": "The correct answer is A. It is permissible to file an opposition in one’s own name while acting on behalf of a third party (G 3/97 and G 4/97). The only two situations that might be considered abuse of process would be if the opponent was acting on behalf of the proprietor, company Y, or the opponent was de facto acting as a professional representative without being qualified. Since in this case the attorney is a qualified European patent attorney acting on behalf of company X, this situation does not arise. Company X will not be party to the proceedings so it will be dependent on the representative during opposition proceedings.",

    "question": "European patent EP-B is granted with a claim directed to a method of operating a heart pacemaker in dependence upon the required cardiac output while a person is exercising, the pacemaker including a pressure sensing means mounted on a pacing lead and adapted to be implanted in a heart and used to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure, which pressure is used to control the pacer rate. Is it permissible in opposition or opposition appeal proceedings to amend the claim to be directed to a heart pacemaker in order to address problems relating to Article 53(c) EPC? A. Yes, a change in claim category is permitted. B. No, a change in claim category would contravene Article 123(3) EPC. Answer The correct",
    "answer": "The correct answer is B. answer is B. A change in claim category from a method of operating a device to the device itself, i.e. deleting the “method features” defining therapeutic operation of the device, would broaden the claim and contravene Article 123(3) EPC (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). The features of the pacemaker as defined in the device claim do not depend on the circumstances of its operation, but they did under the terms of the prior method claim (“while a person is exercising”). If the original claim contains the claimed features of the device exhaustively, the change of category may be allowable (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). This condition is not fulfilled. Method features relating to how the pacemaker is installed in and interacts with the human body cannot be converted to device features, amongst other things because an “adapted to” type formulation does not confer the same limitation. For example, a “pressure sensing means adapted to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure” is not limited to such use, since it can e.g. be used to sense the left ventricular systolic pressure (T 82/93, Reasons 2.2 and 2.3).",

The 31-month period expired on 14 October 2023 (Saturday, extended to 16 October 2023). Since the 31-month time limit was not met, the EPO will issue a communication to the applicant under Rule 160(2) EPC and there will be a two-month period for entry into the EPO regional phase using further processing (Article 121(1) and Rule 135 EPC).

According to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date.

EP1 cannot validly claim priority from FP1 but the priority from FP2 is valid and EP1 may be granted with both claims 1 and 2. C.

    "answer": "The correct answer is C. Given what we know about the prior art, claim 1 will not be granted as it is not novel, whereas at this point there is no relevant prior art against claim 2. It is too late at the filing of EP1 to claim priority from FP1, since approximately 20 months have passed since FP1 was filed. It is also too late to restore the priority under Article 122 EPC, which would have had to happen no later than two months after the 12-month time limit set by Article 87 (1) EPC. FP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1. FP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2. The disclosure of subject-matter A in FP1 takes away the novelty of claim 1 in EP1. Subject-matter A+B was disclosed for the first time in FP2, making FP2 the first filing for this subject-matter. The priority claim is therefore valid for A+B. The effective date for claim 2 is before the publication of FP1, so FP1 cannot be cited as prior art against it.",
