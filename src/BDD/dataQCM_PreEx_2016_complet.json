        "question": "Opposition proceedings are pending against all claims of European patent EP-B. The only ground of opposition is Article 100(c) EPC. Today, 29 February 2016, the EPO receives third party observations against EP-B. The submissions of the third party are as follows: \n- it is explained that prior art document D1 anticipates claim 1 of EP-B; and \n - it is reasoned that the invention in EP-B is not sufficiently disclosed. For each of the statements 1.1 – 1.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: \n \n 1.1 Since third party observations can only be filed concerning issues arising under Articles 52 to 57 EPC, the opposition division will not consider the reasoning concerning lack of sufficiency of disclosure. \n \n1.2 The submissions of the third party will be forwarded by the EPO to the patent proprietor. \n \n1.3 The submissions of the third party will be accessible to the public through file inspection. \n \n1.4 The opposition division is allowed to introduce into the proceedings lack of novelty with respect to claim 1 as a fresh ground for opposition.",

Today is 29 February 2016. 2.1 As soon as the applicant files the translation of the claims and pays the fee for grant and publication, resumption of the examination proceedings is no longer possible. 2.2 If the applicant requests a reasoned amendment to claim 15 today, the applicant must at the same time file the translation of the so amended set of claims and pay the fee for grant and publication. 2.3 If the applicant adds two dependent claims to the set of claims today, the examining division will not examine these two claims, unless claims fees are also paid.2.4 Third party observations on EP-D filed with the EPO today are no longer considered by the examining division, since they are late filed.",
