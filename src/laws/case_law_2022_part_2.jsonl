Introduction\nUnder Art. 82 EPC, the European patent application must relate to one invention only or\nto a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept.\nR. 44(1) EPC (cf.

For international applications the\ncorresponding provisions are Art. 3(4)(iii) and in particular R. 13 PCT.\nAs stated in T 501/91, the main purpose of Art. 82 EPC is to prevent several unrelated\ninventions from being dealt with in a single patent application in order to save fees.

Issues related to completeness of disclosure are also discussed by the\nboards in context with inventive step (see e.g. T 1329/04, T 604/04, T 898/05) and\nindustrial applicability (see e.g. T 870/04, T 641/05, T 1452/06, above chapter I.E.).\nWhether the application discloses sufficient information making it plausible that the\nclaimed polynucleotides or polypeptides have the alleged technical effect was considered\na matter of inventive step (T 743/97; T 1329/04) or industrial applicability (T 1165/06,\n415"}
