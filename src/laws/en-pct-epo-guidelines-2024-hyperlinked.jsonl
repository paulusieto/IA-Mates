Their full name is \"Guidelines for\nSearch and Examination at the European Patent Office as PCT Authority\",\nor \"PCT-EPO Guidelines\" for short, and throughout these Guidelines they\nare also referred to as \"GL/PCT-EPO\".\nThese Guidelines can be used and referred to by examiners and formalities\nofficers, as well as patent attorneys, in addition to the Euro-PCT Guide\n(\"PCT procedure at the EPO, [International phase and entry into the\nEuropean phase], Guide for applicants\"), the PCT-RO (Receiving Office)\nGuidelines and the PCT ISPE (International Search and Preliminary\nExamination) Guidelines.

The electronic publication includes not only the online version\nin HTML format, but also a printable file.\nThe aim is to gradually expand the PCT-EPO Guidelines with each revision\ncycle.

Explanatory notes\n2.1 Overview\nThe PCT-EPO Guidelines follow the structure of the EP Guidelines (Parts\nA, B, C, E, F, G and H, without D because there is no opposition, limitation\nor revocation under the PCT), and as far as possible the organisation within\neach part is similar to that of the EP Guidelines, adapted to the\nparticularities of the PCT system. The sequence of chapters within Part A,\nhowever, differs from that of the EP Guidelines. This is due to the particular\nway in which the content is being gradually extended and the structure may\nbe reconsidered prior to completion of Part A."}

Nevertheless, there are situations in which the\nsearch report and the written opinion cover only part of the subject-matter\nclaimed, or in which no search report is issued. This may be either because\nthe international application includes subject-matter which the ISA is not\nrequired to deal with (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2) or else because the\ndescription, claims or drawings fail to meet a requirement, such as clarity or\nsupport of the claims by the description, to such an extent that no\nmeaningful search can be made of all or some of the claims (see\nGL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3).
