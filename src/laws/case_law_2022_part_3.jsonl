Before the board, the appellant\n(opponent) asserted that the request for correction under R. 88 EPC 1973 ought not to\nhave been granted and that the divisional application was therefore invalid. As a result,\nthe filing date relevant for the patent at issue was the date of receipt of the application on\nwhich it was based. The board found that there were only two alternatives for a European\npatent application filed as a divisional application: either it was not treated as a divisional\napplication, in which case the grant procedure would not even start, or it was treated as a\ndivisional application, in which case it could only be accorded the filing date of its parent\napplication. Since the application on which the patent was based had been filed as a\ndivisional application and then treated as such, there was no choice but to accord it the\nfiling date of the parent application.

Its application to\nprocedures before the EPO implies that measures taken by the EPO should not violate\nthe reasonable expectations of parties to such proceedings (G 5/88; G 7/88; G 8/88,\nOJ 1991, 137).

Preparation of oral proceedings\nf) Newly appointed representative\nIn T 37/97 a new representative had been appointed after the summons to oral\nproceedings had been duly issued. The board rejected the request for postponement and\nheld that the new representative, before taking on the mandate, could be expected to have\nmade sure he was available on the appointed date or to arrange for alternative\nrepresentation. Furthermore, a professional representative could be expected to be able\nto prepare for oral proceedings with all due care within a month unless the case was\nexceptionally difficult, which it was not. See also J 4/03.\nIn T 2018/17 the board stated that the examining division gave no reasons why the\nappointment of a new representative was not regarded as being a serious reason for\nchanging the date for oral proceedings. However, such a reasoning needs to be given if a\ndivision relies on it."}

And on\nthe question of the admissibility of evidence submitted by the intervener, including the\nreintroduction of certain evidence originally submitted by a party but not admitted as late,\nsee T 2951/18.\nAs for the standard of proof, the EPO generally applies the \"balance of probabilities\" (see\nJ 20/85, OJ 1987, 102, point 4 of the Reasons).

However, especially in cases where only one party – the opponent – had\naccess to information about an alleged public prior use, the case law has tended toward\nexpecting that the public prior use be proved beyond any reasonable doubt or \"up to the\nhilt\" (see e.g. T 55/01, point 4.1 of the Reasons; and T 472/92, OJ 1998, 161, point 3.1 of"}
