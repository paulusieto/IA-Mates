In the same period, the Enlarged Board of Appeal has handed down more\nthan 100 decisions and opinions under Article 112 EPC, in order to clarify legal points of\nfundamental importance and ensure a uniform application of the law.\nThe present tenth edition of the \"Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent\nOffice\" provides a comprehensive overview of this case law. It contains summaries of or\nreferences to almost 8 000 decisions which were issued in writing in the period up to the\nend of 2021. Also included are a number of important decisions rendered at the beginning\nof 2022, as well as the questions of law referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal under\nArticle 112 EPC in cases G 2/21, G 1/22 and G 2/22."}

Readers should also note that, between editions,\nregular updates on the Boards' case law are provided by two publications, namely a case\nlaw report with summaries of decisions in the language of the proceedings published on\nthe Boards of Appeal website and the \"EPO Boards of Appeal Case Law\" supplementary\npublications of the EPO Official Journal. Furthermore the html version of the present\nedition will be regularly updated with the catchwords of important new decisions."}

The board referred to the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Re Gale's Application [1991]\nRPC 305. The board's approach to assessing questions of what is and what is not\ntechnical about a computer-implemented method was, in this case, to ask the same\nquestions as Nicholls LJ in Re Gale's Application. The first was what does the method as\na whole do, and does it produce an overall technical result? The second was; if there is no\noverall technical result, does the method at least have a technical effect within the"}

If both questions were answered in the negative, no technical problem had\nbeen solved and there could be no inventive step. The board's view regarding technicality\ncould be summarised as follows; the overall aim of keeping players interested is not\ntechnical. The intermediary aim of assessing and comparing playing performance is not\ntechnical. The representation of performance by probability distributions, and the updating\nof them, are mathematical methods. The use of factor graphs with message-passing is a\nmatter of mathematics or abstract computer science. The board concluded that the only\ntechnical feature defined in this claim was the (computer) processor.
