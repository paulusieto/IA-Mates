Work at the EPO\nThe setting up of the EPO represented a major step forward in the history\nof patents. Its reputation depends on all employees, regardless of\nnationality, working harmoniously together and giving of their best. But it is\non the search, examination and opposition, more than anything else, that\nthe EPO will be judged by the patent world.\nEmployees of the EPO work with colleagues who not only speak a different\nlanguage but also come from a different patent background with different\ntraining. Some may also have had experience in their national patent office.\nIt is therefore important to mention that all employees in the EPO are\nworking under a common system as laid down in the EPC. The Guidelines\nwill support them in applying the same standards.\nOne of the purposes of the Guidelines is also to make clear how the areas\nof responsibility are distributed among the different departments, e.g. the"}

The EPC imposes various time limits on the\nparties. The European patent system will be judged a success only when\nexaminers and other employees also operate within reasonable time\nframes.\nFinally, it should hardly need stating that all European applications and\npatents, regardless of their country of origin and the language in which they\nare written, receive equal treatment. An international patent system can be\ncredible only if all trace of national bias is absent.\n5. Summary of the processing of applications and patents at the"}

There are cases where, although a meaningful analysis is\npossible, a fundamental objection arises, e.g. it is clear that certain claims\nlack novelty and that the statement of claim will have to be drastically\nrecast, or there are substantial amendments (to an international application\nentering the European phase – see B-XI, 2) which are not allowable either\nbecause they add new subject-matter that was not in the application as\nfiled (Art. 123(2)) or because they introduce other deficiencies (e.g. the"}

This should normally be sufficiently clear\nfrom the application as filed. If it is not, the search division will raise an\nobjection in the search opinion (see F-II, 4.5), but only if it is convinced it is\nnecessary, because it might lead the applicant to add subject-matter in\nbreach of Art. 123(2) (see H-IV, 2 and H-V).\n3.6 EPC requirements\nAlthough the search division must bear all the EPC requirements in mind,\nthe ones it is most likely to have to deal with are: sufficiency of disclosure\n(see F-III); clarity and support in the description, especially for the"}

The\nclaims of a divisional application need not be limited to subject-matter\nalready claimed in the parent application's claims. Furthermore, no abuse\nof the system of divisional applications can be identified in the mere fact\nthat the claims of the application on which the examining division had then\nto decide had a broader scope than the claims granted in relation to the\nparent application (see T 422/07).\nHowever, under Art. 76(1), the subject-matter may not extend beyond the\ncontent of the parent application as filed.

The meaning of opposition\nThe public may oppose a granted European patent on the basis of one or\nmore of the grounds mentioned in Art. 100. The grounds on which the\nopposition is based may arise for example from circumstances of which the\nEPO was not aware when the patent was granted (e.g. prior use or a\npublication which was not contained or not found among the material\navailable to the EPO). Opposition is therefore a means by which any\nperson (but see D-I, 4) may obtain the limitation or revocation of a wrongly\ngranted patent.\n2. Opposition after surrender or lapse\nAn opposition may be filed even if the European patent has been Rule 75\nsurrendered or has lapsed for all designated states. This is relevant in that\nin such cases the rights acquired with the patent remain in existence during\nthe period up to surrender or lapse and claims arising from such rights may"}

Evaluation of evidence\n4.1 General remarks\nThe competent department has the power and the duty to assess whether\nthe alleged facts are sufficiently established based on evidence. The\nproceedings under the EPC are governed by the principle of free evaluation\nof evidence. This principle allows, and requires, a competent department to\ndecide according to its own discretion and conviction, by taking into\naccount the entire content of the parties' submissions. There are no firm\nrules according to which certain types of evidence are, or are not,\nconvincing. This does not mean that the evaluation of evidence may be\narbitrary, rather the evidence must be assessed comprehensively and\ndutifully. The only decisive factor is whether the department is convinced of\nthe truth of the factual allegation, i.e. how credible the department classifies\na piece of evidence. To do this, the department must put all the arguments"}

Composition and duties of the examining division\n3.1 Composition\nThe composition of the examining division to which the request is referred\nmust be as defined in Art. 18(2). This means that the division must include\nthree technical examiners; normally a legally qualified examiner will also be\nincluded. The main responsibility for dealing with the request up to the time\nof formulating the opinion is entrusted to one technical examiner,\nhereinafter referred to as the \"primary examiner\".\nIn order to guarantee that the opinion given is not influenced by earlier\nproceedings within the EPO on the application/patent in question,"}

Where this is not practicable, the national\ncourt and the parties are informed of the proposed members of the\nexamining division under Art. 25 and of which among these members\nparticipated in European examination or opposition proceedings on the\ncase.

These\ninclude substantive requirements such as sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83),\nclarity of the claims (Art. 84) and unity of invention (Art. 82) as well as\nrequirements of a more formal nature such as the numbering of the claims\n(Rule 43(5)) and the form of the drawings (as determined by the President\nunder Rule 49(2)). These requirements are dealt with in the present Part F.\nPart F also deals with the requirements relating to the right to priority. This\nis because, despite the fact that this issue is usually assessed only when it\nhas a potential bearing on a question of patentability (see G-IV, 3), it is\nnonetheless assessed independently of any issues of patentability."}
