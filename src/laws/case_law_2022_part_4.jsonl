There are no fees or deadlines\nfor presenting such observations.

Observations that contain legal or technical\ninformation relevant for the decision in hand will generally be considered (T 866/91).\nArt. 115 EPC helps to ensure that no legally invalid patents are granted or maintained.

This means that observations can also be filed during\nopposition proceedings, even after expiry of the opposition period, and during appeal\nproceedings (T 390/90, G 9/91, OJ 1993, 408, T 1756/11).

Third-party observations in opposition-appeal proceedings\n4.1. Third-party observations and the scope of opposition\nExamination of an opposition is limited to the extent to which the patent is opposed in the\nnotice of opposition. If the opponent limits the notice of opposition to certain matters, the\nremaining matters are not opposed within the meaning of Art. 101 and 102 EPC 1973 or\nthe subject of any proceedings within the meaning of Art. 114 and 115 EPC 1973 (G 9/91\nand G 10/91, OJ 1993, 408 and 420). The opponent thereby deliberately refrains from\nexercising his right under the EPC to oppose the other matters covered by the patent and,\nconsequently, the EPO has no competence to deal with them at all. (T 737/92, T 653/02,\nT 31/08).\nFollowing G 9/91 and G 10/91, the board in T 580/89 of 28 April 1993 concluded that it\nhad no power to examine the patentability of the subject-matter of claims which had not"}
