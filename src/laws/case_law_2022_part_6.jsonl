Article 112a(2)(a) EPC – alleged breach of Article 24 EPC\nFor general information on Art. 24 EPC, see chapter III.J. \"Suspected Partiality\". The\npresent chapter deals with decisions of the Enlarged Board under Art. 112a(2)(a) EPC.\nIn R 16/10 the Enlarged Board rejected the petitioner's argument that Art. 24(1) EPC,\nconcerning the exclusion of members from a board, included not only the specific situation\nwhere one of the members had represented a party in the case in question but also the"}
