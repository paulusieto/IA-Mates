Is it permissible in opposition or opposition appeal proceedings to amend the claim to be directed to a heart pacemaker in order to address problems relating to Article 53(c) EPC? A. Yes, a change in claim category is permitted. B. No, a change in claim category would contravene Article 123(3) EPC. Answer The correct", "answer": "The correct answer is B. answer is B. A change in claim category from a method of operating a device to the device itself, i.e. deleting the “method features” defining therapeutic operation of the device, would broaden the claim and contravene Article 123(3) EPC (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). The features of the pacemaker as defined in the device claim do not depend on the circumstances of its operation, but they did under the terms of the prior method claim (“while a person is exercising”). If the original claim contains the claimed features of the device exhaustively, the change of category may be allowable (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). This condition is not fulfilled. Method features relating to how the pacemaker is installed in and interacts with the human body cannot be converted to device features, amongst other things because an “adapted to” type formulation does not confer the same limitation. For example, a “pressure sensing means adapted to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure” is not limited to such use, since it can e.g. be used to sense the left ventricular systolic pressure (T 82/93, Reasons 2.2 and 2.3).", "type": "qcm", "source": "Questions Sup OEB.docx"}

FP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1. FP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2.
