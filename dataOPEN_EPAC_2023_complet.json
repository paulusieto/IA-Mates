        "question": "The applicant filed a US patent application US-A on 23 November 2021. This patent \napplication is currently under examination and a notice of allowance is not expected before 2024. On 20 November 2022, your law firm validly filed a European patent application EP-A in the applicant's name, claiming priority from US-A. A communication under Rule 64(1) EPC is issued on 5 September 2023, indicating a lack of unity because application EP-A comprises three inventions: A1, A2 and A3. \n1. What is the deadline for responding to this communication? Show your calculations. \n2. What steps need to be taken to receive the final search report for invention A1 only? \n3. What steps need to be taken to receive the final search report covering all three inventions? \n4. What steps need to be taken to enable the applicant to obtain examination of inventions A1 and A3 by the EPO? \nThe applicant informs your law firm that it wants to accelerate examination of invention A1 by using Form 1009 or Form 1005. \n5. Can you use these forms to accelerate the proceedings? Please explain your answer. Following a successful request for accelerated examination, a communication under Article 94(3) EPC is issued on A1, but the applicant needs more time to formulate a response and requests an extension of the time limit. \n6. What effect will this request for an extension of the time limit have on the prosecution of A1?",
        "answer": "(a) (Rule 64(1)) has a deadline of 2m from the notification of the communication, \ntherefore the 10-day rule still currently applies. 5 September 2023 + 10d = 15 \nSeptember 2023 + 2m = 15 November 2023. \n \n(b) No action is required. If no response is filed to the R64(1) communication, the \npublished search report will be based on the first mentioned invention (i.e., A1). \n \n(c) Pay two additional search fees (before the calculated deadline of 15 November \n2023). A further search report will be issued covering all three inventions. \n \n(d) Request examination for EP-A and file a divisional application for the second \ninvention. \n \n2 \n(e) A PPH request based on the US-priority application with the USPTO as OEE cannot \nbe filed by using Form 1009 (as the US priority is still under substantive \nexamination). EPO Form 1005 can be used to request accelerated examination \n(PACE). \n \n(f) EP-A will be taken out of the PACE programme due to the request for extension of \ntime.",

        "question": "Your client XYZ was granted a European patent; the language of proceedings was German. XYZ requested validation in Italy, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. During the 9 month opposition period, an opposition to the granted patent was filed, citing Article 100(a) EPC. During the opposition proceedings, a new set of claims was filed. The outcome of the opposition proceedings was that XYZ’s patent was maintained in amended form. No appeal was filed by the parties.
