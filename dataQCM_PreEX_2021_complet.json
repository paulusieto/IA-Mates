        "question": "European patent application EP-P was filed as a first filing on 16 December 2018. EP-P was published on 17 June 2020. Application EP- P-DIV1 was filed with the EPO on 06 December 2019 as a divisional application from EP-P. A second divisional application from EP-P (EP-P- DIV2) was filed with the EPO on 06 November 2020. Today, EP-P is still pending. Some of the claims of EP-P-DIV2 contain subject-matter that was not originally disclosed in EP-P. 3.1 EP-P-DIV1 was not validly filed as a divisional application of EP-P, because EP-P-DIV1 was filed before the publication of EP-P. 3.2 If EP-P was filed in Portuguese and translated into English, EP-P- DIV1 must be filed in English. 3.3 For EP-P-DIV2 an additional fee as part of the filing fee for a divisional application of a second generation had to be paid. 3.4 EP-P will be regarded as prior art under Art. 54(2) EPC against EP-P-DIV2.",
