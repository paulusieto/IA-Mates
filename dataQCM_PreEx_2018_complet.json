On the day of the oral proceedings you arrive with Sarah, but also with Jane and Pedro, whose intention to attend was not previously made known. Jane is a US patent agent. Pedro is employed at the research centre in Portugal. The opponent's representative is also attending the oral proceedings. 2.1 You will be allowed to make oral submissions at the oral proceedings. 2.2 As a general rule, Jane will be allowed to make oral submissions at the oral proceedings. 2.3 As a general rule, Pedro will be allowed to make oral submissions at the oral proceedings. 2.4 If the parties and the opposition division agree, Sarah will be allowed to make oral submissions in Portuguese at the oral proceedings.",

        "question": "Company Z filed a European patent application EP-Z on 30 January 2018, without claiming any priority. EP-Z has eleven claims. Alina and Elena are designated as the inventors of EP-Z. However, Alina is wrongly designated as an inventor. The EPO drew up a search report and a favourable opinion in August 2018. An international application PCT-Z was filed in December 2018, validly claiming the priority of EP-Z. 3.1 The first communication in respect of EP-Z that can be expected from the examining division is a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. 3.2 If you receive a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC for EP-Z in October 2019 and if you fulfil all the requirements of Rule 71(5) EPC on 31 January 2020, no fees other than the grant and publishing fee are due. 3.3 It is possible to cancel the designation of Alina as an inventor of EP-Z without Alina's consent. 3.4 PCT-Z will be deemed to be withdrawn, once a patent is granted on the basis of EP-Z.",

EP-H validly claims priority from an earlier patent application. In the notice of opposition, Hans raised an objection of lack of inventive step of claim 1 over the combination of two prior art documents, D1 and D2. While the opposition proceedings are pending, Theresa files third-party observations, arguing that claim 1 lacks novelty over D3, a German patent application filed before the priority date of EP-H and published after that date. 10.1 Third parties are entitled to file observations during opposition proceedings. 10.2 If oral proceedings are to be held and the opposition division follows Theresa’s objections with regard to novelty, it will also summon Theresa to the oral proceedings. 10.3 If the European patent is maintained in amended form, it could contain different claims for different designated states. 10.4 If Hans does not file a copy of D1 within the opposition period, the opposition will be inadmissible.",
