        "question": "Francesca has filed a European patent application EP-F before the EPO. Francesca did not develop the invention which is the subject of EP-F. In drafting EP-F Francesca used information in Andrew’s laboratory notebook, without Andrew’s consent. EP-F was published in December 2017 and is still pending. For each of the statements 1.1–1.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false : \n1.1 Andrew can seek a stay of proceedings if he provides evidence that he has instituted proceedings against Francesca seeking a decision that Andrew is entitled to the grant of the European patent based on EP-F.  \n1.2 Francesca can withdraw EP-F at any time from the date on which Andrew provides evidence to the EPO that he has instituted proceedings against Francesca seeking a decision that Andrew is entitled to the grant of the European patent based on EP-F.  \n1.3 No renewal fee has to be paid during a stay of proceedings. \n1.4 Andrew can validly request that EP-F be refused no later than three months after the decision recognising his entitlement to EP-F has become final.",

        "question": "Hans filed an admissible notice of opposition against European patent EP-1, which was granted with two independent claims, namely claim 1 and claim 2 relating respectively to two different parts of the patent. The only ground for opposition that he raised was lack of inventive step in respect of claim 1. The opposition is not filed against the patent as a whole, but only against claim 1. In particular, he argued in the notice of opposition that the subject-matter of claim 1 lacked inventive step over the combination of D1 and D2, both published before the effective date of EP-1. Theresa filed third-party observations during the pending opposition proceedings, arguing that claim 2 lacked novelty over D3, a Japanese patent application published before the effective date of EP-1. For the following statements, assume that the right to be heard of all parties involved has been respected and no amendments have been filed during the opposition proceedings. For each of the statements 2.1–2.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: \n2.1 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 1 lacks novelty over D1, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 for lack of novelty of the subject-matter of claim 1. \n2.2 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 2 lacks inventive step over D2 in combination with D3, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 for lack of inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 2 over D2 in combination with D3. \n2.3 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 1 is not sufficiently disclosed, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 because the subject-matter of claim 1 is not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. \n2.4 After the opposition division has considered Theresa’s third-party observations, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 based on lack of novelty of the subject- matter of claim 2.",
